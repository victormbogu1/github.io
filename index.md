### Instacart Project Analysis
* Instacart aim in targeting customers with applicable marketing to gauge sales of their products. Perform an exploratory analysis of Instacart data to derive insights and suggest strategies based on provided criteria. Over 32,000,000 rows of order data are stored in open-source data sets that are available online via Instacart. Additionally, customer data sets created for this study on using Python to analyze data sets were examined in this analysis. As Instacart's data analyst, I used Jupyter Notebook to run code and generate graphs on issues like the busiest hours of the week for the app, the most popular grocery sections, and the average age of users placing orders through the app.
